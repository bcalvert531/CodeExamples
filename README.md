# Code Examples

A library of various Python code examples & research work, mostly centered on financial data analysis & trading. 

1) An implementation of Distinguishing Chaos From Noise - Rosso et al [2007], an information-theoretic method for distinguishing chaotic from noisy systems, and an application to market data.
2) An attempted replication of Backtesting of Trading Strategies for Bitcoin - Glucksmann [2019] using the library Backtrader. 
3) An implementation of the various methods of forming financial market bars from the underlying tick data from Lopez de Prado's Advances in Financial Machine Learning, including the usual time bars (a bar of Open High Low Close prices per a user-specified period of time) but also tick-, dollar-, volume-, and buy/sell imbalance-bars.
4) A cannonical implementation of Sornette's Log Periodic Power Law Singularity model of financial bubbles and crashes. Following the presentation in Demos's 2017 dissertation Information Geometry & the Dynamic Detection of Financial Bubbles & Crashes.
